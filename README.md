  ## Description:
  ```
  To create an application that generates a quality README file, based on a
  user's response to questions which reflect the contents of a good README file. 
  The app is simple to use, making use of the command-line-interface CLI, 
  allowing the user to enter text which is subsequently added to a README. 
  Formatting is also taken care of, saving the user valuable time on their projects.
  ```
