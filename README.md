  ## Description:
  ```
  The purpose of this application is to generate a quality README file, based on a
  user's response to questions which reflect the contents of a good README file. 
  The app is simple to use, making use of the command-line-interface CLI in either
  terminal (Mac) or Bash/Shell (Windows). The user's responses are added to a README
  file which is automatically generated. Formatting is also taken care of, 
  saving the user valuable time on their projects.
